**Defects in Power Distribution Components** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the energy industry.

The dataset consists of 708 images with 707 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *Cable out of insulator*, *Cable out of spacer*, and *Insulator withour ring*.

Each image in the DefectsPDC dataset has bounding boxes annotations. There is 1 unlabled image (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds* (708 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the [State University of Maranh√£o](https://www.uema.br/).

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
