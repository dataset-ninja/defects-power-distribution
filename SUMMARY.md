**Defects in Power Distribution Components** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the energy industry. 

The dataset consists of 708 images with 707 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *Cable out of insulator*, *Cable out of spacer*, and *Insulator withour ring*.

Images in the Defects in Power Distribution Components dataset have bounding box annotations. There is 1 unlabeled image (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2020 by the [State University of Maranh√£o, Brazil](https://www.uema.br/).

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
