**Defects in Power Distribution Components** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the energy industry. 

The dataset consists of 708 images with 707 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *cable out of insulator*, *cable out of spacer*, and *insulator withour ring*.

Images in the Defects in Power Distribution Components dataset have bounding box annotations. There is 1 unlabeled image (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2020 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">State University of Maranh√£o, Brazil</span>.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
